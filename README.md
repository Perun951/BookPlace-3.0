# BookPlace-3.0

### About the project

The final version of a project with wich I hope to enable the free and open access to educational material that are in the public domain for everyone who find himself in need. 

The project presents a website in which everyone will be able to download for free .pdf and .epub files that contain knowledge and that are posted in the public domain.

The website was creeated for a contest schedueld at the time of writing of this readme file to take place in May of 2023.
